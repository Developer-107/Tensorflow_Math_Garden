# ðŸŒ± TensorFlow Math Garden

TensorFlow Math Garden is a simple, browser-based addition trainer built with TensorFlow.js. Inspired by an App Brewery concept but completely rebuilt from scratch, this project was created to practice and strengthen my frontend machine learning skills.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- This project was developed entirely for learning purposes. It helped me:
- Understand how to build and train neural networks in the browser
- Gain experience with TensorFlow.js
- Learn how machine learning models can be applied to basic math problems
- Build everything from scratch, including the custom model architecture

âž• What It Does
- Uses a custom-built neural network to learn and predict simple addition problems (e.g., 3 + 5 = 8)
- Lets users input training data and see how the model improves over time
- Provides live predictions directly in the browser with no backend required
- Offers a visual and interactive way to explore how ML models work

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- TensorFlow.js â€“ for building and training the neural network
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS â€“ for the frontend interface
