# ðŸŒ± TensorFlow Math Garden

TensorFlow Math Garden is a simple web-based addition trainer built with TensorFlow.js. It was originally inspired by an App Brewery project but built entirely from scratch to practice and strengthen my understanding of machine learning in the browser.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project is purely for learning purposes. It helped me get hands-on experience with:

TensorFlow.js fundamentals

Creating and training models directly in the browser

Handling number inputs and training data manually

Visualizing model predictions in real-time

âž• What It Does
Trains a basic neural network to learn simple addition (e.g., 3 + 5 = 8)

Accepts user-defined input data pairs and trains the model interactively

Displays predicted outputs and adjusts as the model learns

All computation happens in the browser with no server-side code

ðŸ§° Tech Stack

TensorFlow.js â€“ machine learning in the browser
JavaScript / HTML / CSS â€“ UI and interaction
